# Welcome to <ins>fin-math-notes</ins> repository
This repository contains materials on mathematical finance that may be useful for both who aspiring to find a structured approach for studying this field of finance and for those who want to apply modern and sophisticated models in practice. Some of the materials are accompanied with corresponding notes in order to increase the transparency of the material being studied.

## Structure
All materials and notes are divided into 4 sections. 
1. [Longreads](https://github.com/kinest22/fin-math-notes/tree/main/longreads)<br>
These are fundamental works (mainly textbooks or subject-matter courses) that bring the reader broad understanding of the subject.
<br>

2. [Papers](https://github.com/kinest22/fin-math-notes/tree/main/papers)<br>
These are research papers devoted to specific topics in mathematical finance field.
<br>

3. [Seminals]()<br>
These are papers that are considered seminal in the academic literature due to their significant contribution to the mathematical finance evolvement.
<br>

4. [Essentials]()<br>
These are handwritten notes on mathematical finance essential topics that are useful in understanding more advanced concepts one can encounter while studying materials from other sections.
