## Probability space definition

One can notice that the formalization of stochastic (random) processes modelling in mathematical finance is commonly accompanied by the notation $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$. This triplet was introduced by Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov in 1933 as part of his probability theory axiomatics and is called **probability space**. Kolmogorov's axiomatics is based on the **set theory**, as reflected in notation used. 

Probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$ includes:
1. $\Omega$ — an arbitrary non-empty set which elements are called elementary events, outcomes or points.
2. $\mathcal{F}$ (or sometimes $\mathfrak{A}$) — algebra over $\Omega$ ($\sigma$-algebra or $\sigma$-field).
3. $\mathbb{P}$ — probability measure.
